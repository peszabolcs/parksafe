# Google Authentication Setup Guide

## What's Already Done âœ…

1. **Dependencies installed**: `expo-auth-session` and `expo-crypto`
2. **Login screen updated**: Google sign-in button and logic added
3. **App configuration**: Scheme "parksafe" already configured in app.json

## What You Need to Do ðŸ”§

### 1. Get Your Google Client ID

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (or create one)
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" â†’ "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Choose "Android" as application type
6. For Android, you'll need:
   - Package name: `com.parksafe.app` (already in your app.json)
   - SHA-1 certificate fingerprint (see step 2)

### 2. Get Your SHA-1 Certificate Fingerprint

For development, run this command in your project directory:
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

For production, you'll need the SHA-1 from your release keystore.

### 3. Update the Client ID in Your Code

In `app/login.tsx`, replace `'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'` on line 35 with your actual Google Client ID:

```typescript
clientId: 'your-actual-google-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com',
```

### 4. Configure Supabase

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication â†’ Providers
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add your Google Client ID and Client Secret
4. Set the redirect URL to: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### 5. Test the Integration

1. Run your app: `npm start`
2. Try the Google sign-in button
3. The OAuth flow should redirect to Google and back to your app

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid client" error**: Make sure your Google Client ID is correct
- **"Redirect URI mismatch"**: Verify the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches your app's scheme
- **"Provider not enabled"**: Ensure Google provider is enabled in Supabase dashboard

## Security Notes

- Never commit your Google Client Secret to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration in production
- The Client ID is safe to include in your app code
